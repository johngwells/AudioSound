Project is based off the Web Audio Api

the plan is to make a synthesizer which you can play, create sounds,
store individual sounds/presets, share recordings.

front end: JavaScript, React
backend: MongoDB for users to create an account: to record, share, save sounds & use the synthesizer.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
